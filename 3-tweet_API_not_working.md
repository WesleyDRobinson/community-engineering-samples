someone tweets: ‚ÄúHey, Adobe CC: your API isn‚Äôt working‚Äù
walk us through some possible courses of action for the following two scenarios:

    i. We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

    ii. We did a quick gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.

Twitter is a tricky platform. It's difficult to build a solid, positive reputation but there are many opportunities for negative interactions from frustrated customers.

@CreativeSDK could do more to engage the developer community, and it's important to select our spots and build a solid image!
It takes effort to train a model/tone by highlighting positive exchanges and ideas, focusing more on high-influence users, and sharing helpful resources.

However, if we respond primarily as a direct support line, that's what users may come to expect.
I think it would be a good idea to avoid the @CreativeSDK handle becoming a support line, as Twitter just won't be the right channel to resolve many issues.

With that being said, as of today, for the situation where APIs are operational, I think the tweet would be best ignored, actually.

If we put infrastructure in place to support Twitter engagement, directing this customer to @AdobeCare, could be an appropriate reply. Something like:
"Thanks for reaching out! We can work to resolve the issue; please reach out to [@AdobeCare] with additional details."

For the situation where APIs are broken, we might want to avoid 1-1 tweeting regarding support issues; or we could quickly thank the reporters!
And using the @CreativeSDK handle to broadly announce critical API status updates seems like it would a good usage to build community credibility!

"I looked at they're twitter profile and the seem to be inactive so I doubt they'll fix it"
